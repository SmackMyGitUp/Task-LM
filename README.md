Completed the home task that was given to me.

Considering I hadn't used TestNG and Selenide, I think I managed to do okay.

While learning to use the new tools was a bit of a struggle, with lots of help from the internet and ChatGPT, I eventually managed to cobble this stuff together.

I'd still prefer doing it with Playwright.
